# Python Configuration Script for zkEVM Network Deployment

## Overview

This script is designed to establish a standardized configuration for deploying a zkEVM network. It defines a comprehensive set of default parameters that are essential for the network's operation and provides mechanisms to merge these defaults with user-provided configurations.

## Key Components

### Constants

- `DEFAULT_ARGS`: A dictionary containing default values for various network components and settings, including Docker images for various services, ports, private keys, database credentials, and more.

### Functions

#### `parse_args(args)`

##### Description

Processes and merges user-provided arguments with the default parameters to create a full configuration set for the deployment.

##### Parameters

- `args`: A dictionary containing user-provided configuration parameters.

##### Returns

- A dictionary with merged configuration settings.

#### `fill_dict(my_dict, def_values)`

##### Description

A helper function that merges two dictionaries, providing a fallback to default values where user configurations are not specified. This function supports one level of nested dictionaries due to the lack of recursion in Starlark.

##### Parameters

- `my_dict`: The primary dictionary containing user-provided configurations.
- `def_values`: The default configuration values.

##### Returns

- A new dictionary with configurations merged from both the user's input and the default settings.

## Configuration Details

The `DEFAULT_ARGS` dictionary includes configurations for:

- **Service Images**: Specifies the Docker images for various services such as the prover, node, data availability, and user interface.
- **Network Settings**: Includes chain IDs, RPC URLs, WebSocket URLs, and settings for various Ethereum and zkEVM-specific functionalities.
- **Database Configurations**: Details for multiple databases involved in the network, including hostnames, database names, user credentials, and ports.
- **Contract and Keystore Settings**: Addresses and private keys for different roles and functionalities within the network.
- **Deployment Specifics**: Such as images for blockchain explorers, network consensus parameters, and ports for various network services.

## Usage

The script is typically used in deployment pipelines where Ethereum zkEVM environments are being set up. It ensures that all necessary parameters are specified and defaults are applied appropriately, facilitating a seamless and error-free deployment process.

## Security and Data Handling

Sensitive information such as private keys and database passwords are handled within this script, necessitating careful management and security measures to prevent unauthorized access.

## Conclusion

This script is a crucial component in the deployment infrastructure for zkEVM networks, providing a robust framework for managing deployment configurations and ensuring that all network components are correctly configured and launched.
