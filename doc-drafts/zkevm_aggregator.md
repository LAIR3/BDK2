Function: create_agglayer_service_config

Description:

This function generates a service configuration for the zkEVM aggregation layer, which is designed to be deployed in an environment using the Kurtosis SDK or a similar container orchestration framework. The function takes in specific arguments related to deployment, image configuration, and keystore artifacts and returns a dictionary containing the configuration for the aggregation layer service.

Parameters:
```bash
    args (dict):
    A dictionary containing various parameters required for setting up the service. Expected keys include:
        "deployment_suffix": A string that will be appended to the service name to differentiate it based on the deployment environment.
        "zkevm_agglayer_image": The Docker image used for the aggregation layer.
        "zkevm_agglayer_port": The port number on which the aggregation layer service will be exposed.
        "zkevm_prometheus_port": The port number on which Prometheus metrics for the aggregation layer will be exposed.

    config_artifact (str):
    The name of the configuration artifact that will be mounted into the service.

    agglayer_keystore_artifact (str):
    The name of the keystore artifact required by the aggregation layer, which will also be mounted into the service.
```
Returns:

    dict:
    A dictionary where the key is the service name, which is dynamically generated by combining "zkevm-agglayer" with the "deployment_suffix", and the value is a ServiceConfig object that contains the service configuration.

ServiceConfig Details:
```bash
    image (str):
    The Docker image for the zkEVM aggregation layer, as specified by args["zkevm_agglayer_image"].

    ports (dict):
    A dictionary mapping service names to PortSpec objects. This service exposes two ports:
        "agglayer": Mapped to the port specified in args["zkevm_agglayer_port"], using the HTTP protocol.
        "prometheus": Mapped to the port specified in args["zkevm_prometheus_port"], using the HTTP protocol.

    files (dict):
    A dictionary mapping paths to Directory objects that specify which artifacts should be mounted into the service. The following directory is mounted:
        "/etc/zkevm": Contains the configuration and keystore artifacts needed by the service.

    entrypoint (list):
    The command used to start the aggregation layer service, which is /usr/local/bin/agglayer.

    cmd (list):
    The command arguments passed to the entrypoint, specifically to run the aggregation layer with the configuration file located at "/etc/zkevm/agglayer-config.toml"
```
    # example agglayer-config.toml
```python
    args = {
    "deployment_suffix": "-prod",
    "zkevm_agglayer_image": "my-registry/zkevm-agglayer:latest",
    "zkevm_agglayer_port": 8080,
    "zkevm_prometheus_port": 9090,
}

config_artifact = "zkevm-config"
agglayer_keystore_artifact = "zkevm-keystore"

service_config = create_agglayer_service_config(args, config_artifact, agglayer_keystore_artifact)
```
