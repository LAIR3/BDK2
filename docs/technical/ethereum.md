# Python Script for Configuring Ethereum Execution and Consensus Layers

## Overview

This script is designed to facilitate the configuration and launch of an Ethereum environment that integrates both execution and consensus layers using the Ethereum package from Kurtosis. It automates the deployment process by specifying container images for Ethereum clients and configuration details for validators.

## Key Components

- **Ethereum Package**: Imported from Kurtosis, this package provides the necessary functionalities to set up an Ethereum blockchain network environment.

## Key Variables

- `GETH_IMAGE`: Specifies the Docker image for the Geth client, used in the execution layer.
- `LIGHTHOUSE_IMAGE`: Specifies the Docker image for the Lighthouse client, used in both the consensus layer and as a validator client.

## Function: `run(plan, args)`

### Description

Configures and deploys an Ethereum environment with pre-defined execution and consensus layer settings. It sets up the network parameters, including network IDs and mnemonic phrases for validators.

### Parameters

- `plan`: An object managing the deployment plan which provides methods for orchestrating the blockchain environment setup.
- `args`: A dictionary containing parameters such as the blockchain network ID, validator key mnemonics, and additional service configurations.

### Workflow

1. **Ethereum Package Execution**:
   - Calls the `ethereum_package.run` method, passing a structured dictionary that outlines the Ethereum network configuration. This dictionary includes:
     - Participant details like the type of execution and consensus layer clients, their respective Docker images, and the number of nodes.
     - Network parameters such as the network ID and a mnemonic for validator keys.
     - Any additional services required in the deployment.

2. **Network Configuration**:
   - Configures the network parameters, setting details like the network ID and pre-registered validator keys based on the passed arguments.

3. **Service Deployment**:
   - Deploys the Ethereum clients and validator clients as specified, integrating all configuration details into the network setup.

### Helper Elements

- The script simplifies the deployment of Ethereum networks by abstracting complex configurations into a more manageable form, leveraging the Kurtosis Ethereum package's capabilities.

## Configuration and Template Management

The configuration is managed dynamically through parameters passed to the Ethereum package, allowing for flexible and scalable blockchain network setups.

## Security and Data Handling

Handles sensitive data such as network IDs and validator mnemonics with care, ensuring they are securely passed to the Ethereum package without exposure to external entities.

## Usage

Designed for use in environments where Ethereum blockchain networks are deployed and tested, such as development or staging environments. It requires a pre-configured deployment plan and appropriate argument values to function correctly.

## Conclusion

This script demonstrates an effective use of Python for blockchain infrastructure setup, focusing on simplifying the deployment of Ethereum networks with multiple layer configurations. It ensures a smooth and secure setup process, ideal for environments requiring rapid deployment and configuration of Ethereum nodes.
